                I'm a passionate AI engineer driven by curiosity about how intelligent
                systems can solve real-world problems. My journey began with an deep interest
                in technology and has evolved into a strong focus on artificial intelligence, 
                machine learning, and modern AI tools.
              </p>
              <p>
                I specialize in building AI-powered applications using modern frameworks and technologies,
                from developing intelligent chatbots and data-driven systems to working with large 
                language models and automation solutions. My approach combines strong 
                software engineering principles with innovative AI thinking to create practical 
                and impactful solutions.
              </p>
              <p>
                When I'm not building AI projects, I explore emerging technologies, 
                experiment with new models and tools, and continuously expand my knowledge 
                in the fast-moving world of AI.
